# Tao Mandalas in Turtle Graphics üê¢

Coming straight from the arsenal of the Masters of the Mystic Arts, Tao Mandalas are protective shields created by magic.

As seen in the image above, one of the most popular user of the magic is Dr. Strange. For my midterm output, I decided to create my own version of the magical shield using Turtle Graphics.

With my imagination and various Python coding techniques such as loops and functions, I was able to come up with something I am proud of. As mentioned earlier, Tao Mandalas are magical shield and I hope my output can protect me from bugs, errors, and a midterm grade of 3.0 or 5.0.
